The causes of this volatility include growing populations, changes in dietary habits, increased use of bio-fuels and climate change. But trade, the conveyor belt between supply and demand, has been a factor too. When governments, often for understandable reasons, employ export restrictions they decrease the available supply of food on world markets and drive prices up. How should the trading system adequately balance the needs of importers and exporters?

More and more products are “Made in the World” rather than “Made in the UK” or “Made in France”. The statistical bias created by attributing the full commercial value to the last country of origin can pervert the political debate on the origin of the imbalances and lead to misguided, and hence counter-productive, decisions. The challenge is to find the right statistical bridges between the different statistical frameworks and national accounting systems to ensure that international interactions resulting from globalization are properly reflected and to facilitate cross border dialogue between national decision makers.",

It is the Parliaments of WTO members which must approve the agreements struck by negotiators in Geneva. Parliamentarians also play the important role of enhancing the transparency of the multilateral trading system and help citizens better understand WTO rules so that they may benefit from them more fully. Donald Oliver, President of the Canadian Inter-Parliamentary Union and Member of the Canadian Senate, and Usama Al-Kurdi, Member of Saudi Arabia’s Shura Council, discussed this issue with Keith Rockwell, WTO Spokesperson.",
